#FIRST PROGRAM (fileorganizer.ipynb, Jupyter, Python)

The goal of the first program is to analyze ALL files within a folder (which folder path must be entered manually within the main), understand through their extensions what type of files they are, and categorize them within 3 sub-folders (Images, docs, audio). 
An implementation to be made to this step is to be able to analyze any type of file with any type of extension, so for now, all files that the program does not know, in terms of extension, will be placed in a separate folder, named "other".

In addition, the program has a second goal to analyze all images inside the folder "images" to define whether the image is grayscale, RGB or RGBA. 

The first time the program is started, it will create a CSV file named "recap" in which we are going to store the names and sizes of all the files analyzed and moved in their respective folders. Each time we re-run the program the "recap" file will be updated. 

#SECOND PROGRAM (addfile.py, VisualStudioCode, Python)

The goal of the second program is essentially the same as the first but instead of iterating over all the files within the folder, through a command line interface (CLI), it allows the user to enter the name of a particular file that you want to move. The program will consequently move only the program desired by the user, updating the "recap" CSV file from time to time
